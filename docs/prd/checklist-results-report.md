## Recommendations

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
1. **Protocol Research:** Gather Pharaoh and Blackhole documentation before architecture phase
2. **RPC Provider Analysis:** Validate rate limits and batching capabilities with chosen providers
3. **Transaction Simulation Strategy:** Define approach for workflow validation before execution

## Final Decision

**âœ… READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD is comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. Minor protocol documentation gaps can be addressed during architecture phase without blocking progress.

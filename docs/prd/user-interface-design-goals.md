# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

JarrBank transforms the overwhelming complexity of multi-chain DeFi portfolio management into an intuitive, action-oriented workspace. The interface prioritizes immediate portfolio health visibility and streamlined workflow execution over comprehensive data display. Users land on a dashboard that immediately surfaces their portfolio composition, health insights, and ready-to-execute optimization opportunities. The design philosophy emphasizes "glanceable intelligence" - critical information visible within seconds, with progressive disclosure for detailed analysis.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

**Dashboard-Centric Navigation:** Primary interaction model revolves around a customizable main dashboard with user-defined sections that eliminate navigation friction. Users customize their workspace based on their DeFi strategy focus areas.

**Guided Workflow Execution:** Multi-step DeFi operations (cross-LP compounding) use progressive wizard interfaces that break complex transactions into digestible steps with clear progress indicators and validation at each stage.

**Context-Aware Actions:** Action buttons and recommendations appear contextually based on portfolio state - e.g., "Compound Available" badges appear on LP positions with claimable rewards, reducing cognitive load of identifying opportunities.

**Mobile-First Responsive Design:** Interface adapts seamlessly from desktop power-user workspace to mobile quick-check and monitoring, maintaining full functionality across screen sizes.

## Core Screens and Views

**Main Portfolio Dashboard:** Comprehensive overview showing total portfolio value, asset distribution charts, LP position summaries, and health score with immediate access to customization controls and quick actions.

**Cross-LP Compounding Wizard:** Multi-step workflow interface guiding users through emission claiming, swap ratio calculations, and compounding execution with transaction simulation and confirmation steps.

**Portfolio Health Analysis View:** Detailed breakdown of portfolio composition, diversification metrics, risk assessments, and actionable recommendations with drill-down capabilities for specific insights.

**Individual LP Position Detail:** Deep-dive view for specific liquidity positions showing historical performance, accumulated fees, underlying asset ratios, and position-specific optimization opportunities.

**Workflow History and Status:** Transaction history and status tracking for automated workflows with detailed execution logs, success metrics, and troubleshooting information for failed operations.

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Implementing WCAG AA compliance to ensure DeFi accessibility for users with disabilities, including keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and sufficient color contrast ratios. Financial interfaces require high accessibility standards given the critical nature of fund management.

## Branding

Clean, professional aesthetic that conveys trustworthiness and technical competence without intimidating non-technical users. Visual hierarchy emphasizes data clarity and actionable elements. Color palette uses high-contrast combinations for financial data readability with accent colors to highlight optimization opportunities and health status indicators.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Web-first responsive design optimized for desktop workflow management while maintaining full mobile functionality. Progressive Web App capabilities enable mobile installation and push notifications for workflow completion status.

# Epic 1: Foundation & Multi-Chain Portfolio Visibility

**Epic Goal:** Establish the core technical infrastructure and deliver immediate value through comprehensive multi-chain portfolio visibility that enables users to see their complete DeFi portfolio (tokens and basic LP positions) across Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Avalanche in a single interface for the first time.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Development Environment
As a developer,
I want to establish the foundational project structure with Next.js 15.4.5, TypeScript, and essential tooling,
so that I have a solid development foundation that supports rapid iteration and maintains code quality.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Next.js 15.4.5 monorepo created with TypeScript configuration and proper folder structure
2. Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components library integrated and configured
3. ESLint, Prettier, and Husky pre-commit hooks established for code consistency
4. Environment configuration setup for development, staging, and production
5. Basic CI/CD pipeline configured with GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
6. Initial deployment to Vercel with health check endpoint returning project status and "Hello JarrBank" message

## Story 1.2: Wallet Connection with Mock Portfolio Display
As a DeFi user,
I want to securely connect my wallet and see a demo portfolio with sample data,
so that I can verify the wallet connection works and preview the portfolio interface.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Wagmi v2 + VIEM integration supporting MetaMask, WalletConnect, and Coinbase Wallet
2. Wallet connection UI with shadcn/ui components showing connection status
3. Network switching functionality for Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Avalanche
4. Wallet address display with ENS resolution when available
5. Mock portfolio data display (sample tokens and LP positions) when wallet connected
6. Basic dashboard layout showing mock data with proper UI components

## Story 1.3: Visual UI Feedback System with Playwright MCP (COMPLETED)
As a QA engineer,
I want to implement a visual feedback system using Playwright MCP,
so that I can provide interactive UI testing and visual verification during development.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Playwright MCP integration for browser automation
2. Visual feedback system for UI element verification
3. Interactive testing capabilities during development
4. Screenshot and snapshot capabilities for visual regression
5. Integration with existing testing infrastructure

### Status
**COMPLETED** - Implemented successfully with Playwright MCP integration

## Story 1.4: E2E Web3 Testing Framework (ATTEMPTED - ARCHIVED)
As a developer,
I want to implement comprehensive E2E Web3 testing with Synpress,
so that I can automate testing of MetaMask wallet connections and DeFi interactions.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Synpress integration for MetaMask automation
2. E2E tests for wallet connection flows
3. Network switching test automation
4. Transaction flow testing capabilities
5. CI/CD pipeline integration for E2E tests

### Status
**ARCHIVED** - Initial Synpress-based implementation plan was created but the story was manually implemented using an alternative approach. See `docs/stories/1.4.e2e-web3-testing.md` for details.

## Story 1.5: Multi-Chain RPC Infrastructure with Health Check
As a developer,
I want to implement efficient batched RPC calls with a working health check system,
so that I can validate RPC connectivity and establish the data fetching foundation.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. RPC provider configuration with Alchemy/Infura primary and fallback endpoints
2. Batched RPC call system with example batch operation (multiple eth_getBalance calls)
3. Redis caching layer for RPC responses with configurable TTL
4. Rate limiting protection with exponential backoff and queue management
5. Chain-specific error handling and failover mechanisms
6. Health check endpoint that tests RPC connectivity to all three chains

## Story 1.6: Live Token Balance Integration
As a DeFi user,
I want to see my actual token balances across all chains replacing the mock data,
so that I can view my real portfolio instead of sample data.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Replace mock token data with live balance fetching using batched RPC calls
2. Price data integration with CoinGecko API including fallback to DefiLlama
3. USD value calculations with proper decimal handling and formatting
4. Token metadata resolution (name, symbol, decimals) with caching
5. Portfolio total value calculation and chain-wise breakdown display
6. Graceful fallback to "No tokens found" when wallet has no balances

## Story 1.7: Live LP Position Integration
As a DeFi user,
I want to see my actual liquidity provider positions replacing mock LP data,
so that I can track my real LP investments alongside my token holdings.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Replace mock LP data with live LP token detection for major protocols
2. LP token balance fetching and position value calculation using real price data
3. Protocol identification and LP pair composition display
4. LP position value calculation using underlying token prices
5. Aggregated LP value integration into portfolio totals
6. Support for detecting LP positions on all three target chains

## Story 1.8: Portfolio Refresh and Error Handling
As a DeFi user,
I want to refresh my portfolio data and see clear error messages when things fail,
so that I can get updated information and understand any connectivity issues.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Manual refresh button that updates all portfolio data with loading indicators
2. Comprehensive error handling for RPC failures, price API failures, and network issues
3. User-friendly error messages with retry suggestions
4. Loading skeletons during data fetching with proper state management
5. Automatic retry logic for transient failures with user notification
6. Connection status indicator showing RPC and price API health

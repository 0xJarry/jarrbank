# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Deliver 75% reduction in weekly DeFi maintenance time (from 3 hours to 45 minutes) for power users
- Enable one-click cross-LP compounding automation across multiple protocols and chains
- Provide customizable portfolio health analytics with actionable insights and recommendations
- Achieve comprehensive multi-chain portfolio visibility across Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Avalanche
- Build efficient batched RPC architecture that minimizes rate limiting while maintaining data freshness
- Establish foundation for expanding from individual power users to professional DeFi operators

## Background Context

JarrBank addresses the critical gap between passive portfolio tracking tools (like DeBank) and the complex manual workflows that DeFi power users currently perform. The platform transforms time-intensive DeFi portfolio management into an efficient, automated experience through intelligent workflow orchestration.

The current DeFi landscape forces users managing 5+ liquidity positions across multiple protocols to spend 2-3 hours weekly on manual maintenance tasks - claiming emissions, calculating optimal swap ratios, and executing separate compounding transactions. JarrBank's core innovation is automated cross-LP compounding, enabling users to consolidate earnings from multiple liquidity positions into optimized target investments with one-click execution, representing the first solution in the market to automate complex cross-protocol workflows.

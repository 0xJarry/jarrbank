# Epic 4: Cross-LP Compounding Workflows

**Epic Goal:** Deliver the core differentiating feature through guided multi-click workflows that enable users to claim emissions from multiple LP positions, swap to optimal ratios, and compound into target positions, transforming manual DeFi maintenance into streamlined execution.

## Story 4.1: Workflow Planning and Simulation Engine
As a DeFi user,
I want to plan and simulate cross-LP compounding workflows before execution,
so that I can understand the expected outcomes and validate the workflow before committing transactions.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Workflow builder interface allowing selection of source LP positions for claiming
2. Target position selection with optimal ratio calculations for compounding
3. Transaction simulation showing expected token amounts at each step
4. Gas cost estimation for the complete workflow across all steps
5. Slippage tolerance configuration with impact warnings
6. Workflow summary display with clear before/after portfolio projections

## Story 4.2: Multi-Position Emission Claiming
As a DeFi user,
I want to claim pending rewards and fees from multiple LP positions in an organized sequence,
so that I can efficiently harvest earnings without manually visiting each protocol interface.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Batch selection interface for choosing LP positions with claimable rewards
2. Claim transaction sequencing with progress indicators and status updates
3. Transaction failure handling with retry mechanisms and clear error messages
4. Claimed amount tracking and confirmation for each successful claim
5. Post-claim balance updates showing newly claimed tokens
6. Integration with wallet transaction confirmation flow

## Story 4.3: Optimal Swap Ratio Calculator
As a DeFi user,
I want the system to calculate optimal swap ratios for compounding claimed tokens into target LP positions,
so that I can maximize the efficiency of my compounding without manual calculations.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Swap ratio calculation algorithm based on target LP pool composition
2. Current pool ratio fetching and optimal entry point determination
3. Slippage impact calculation and adjustment recommendations
4. Multiple swap path evaluation for best execution rates
5. Swap ratio visualization with clear input/output token quantities
6. Real-time ratio updates as market conditions change

## Story 4.4: Guided Swap Execution
As a DeFi user,
I want to execute the calculated swaps to achieve optimal ratios for LP compounding,
so that I can efficiently convert my claimed rewards into the proper token ratios.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Swap transaction preparation with DEX router integration
2. Multi-step swap execution for complex token conversions
3. Swap progress tracking with transaction status updates
4. Slippage protection and transaction deadline management
5. Post-swap balance verification and ratio confirmation
6. Failed swap handling with alternative routing suggestions

## Story 4.5: LP Position Compounding Execution
As a DeFi user,
I want to add my optimally swapped tokens to existing or new LP positions,
so that I can complete the compounding process and maximize my yield-bearing assets.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. LP position addition interface with optimal token amount calculations
2. Existing position compounding vs. new position creation options
3. LP token minting transaction execution with proper approval handling
4. Position update confirmation and new LP token balance display
5. Compound transaction success verification and portfolio updates
6. Integration with position performance tracking for compound impact measurement

## Story 4.6: Workflow History and Analytics
As a DeFi user,
I want to track my compounding workflow history and analyze the impact on my portfolio,
so that I can measure the effectiveness of automation and optimize future workflows.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Workflow execution history with detailed step-by-step logs
2. Compounding impact analysis showing before/after position values
3. Efficiency metrics: time saved, gas costs, yield improvement estimates
4. Workflow success rate tracking and failure analysis
5. Historical workflow comparison and optimization suggestions
6. Export functionality for workflow data and performance analysis

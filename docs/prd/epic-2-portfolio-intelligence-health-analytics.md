2. Category definitions stored in configuration with market cap and protocol thresholds
3. Token category display in portfolio table with color-coded badges
4. Category-based portfolio composition breakdown with percentages
5. Manual category override capability for edge cases or personal preferences
6. Default "Other" category for unrecognized tokens with option to suggest categorization

## Story 2.2: Portfolio Composition Analytics
As a DeFi user,
I want to see visual breakdowns of my portfolio composition by category and chain,
so that I can assess my diversification and risk exposure at a glance.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Portfolio composition pie chart showing percentage breakdown by token category
2. Chain distribution visualization showing asset allocation across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche
3. Top holdings table displaying largest positions by USD value and portfolio percentage
4. Portfolio concentration metrics (e.g., "Top 3 holdings represent 67% of portfolio")
5. Historical composition tracking to show changes over time (basic 7-day comparison)
6. Export functionality for composition data as CSV or image

## Story 2.3: Portfolio Health Score Engine
As a DeFi user,
I want to receive a numerical health score for my portfolio with clear explanations,
so that I can understand my overall portfolio quality and areas for improvement.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Health score calculation (0-100) based on diversification, risk factors, and composition
2. Health score breakdown showing contributing factors: diversification, concentration, risk exposure
3. Score history tracking with trend indicators (improving/declining over time)
4. Clear scoring methodology explanation available to users
5. Health score badge display prominently in portfolio overview
6. Score recalculation trigger when portfolio data updates

## Story 2.4: Actionable Health Recommendations
As a DeFi user,
I want to receive specific, actionable recommendations to improve my portfolio health,
so that I can make informed decisions about rebalancing or risk management.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Dynamic recommendation engine that generates suggestions based on portfolio analysis
2. Recommendation types: diversification improvements, risk reduction, concentration alerts
3. Specific actionable language (e.g., "Consider reducing meme coin exposure from 47% to under 20%")
4. Priority ranking of recommendations by impact on portfolio health
5. Recommendation dismissal capability with "remind me later" option
6. Integration with portfolio health score showing projected improvement from following recommendations

## Story 2.5: Risk Exposure Analysis
As a DeFi user,
I want to understand my exposure to various risk factors (protocol risk, impermanent loss, etc.),
so that I can make informed decisions about my DeFi strategy.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Risk factor identification for LP positions: impermanent loss risk, protocol risk, liquidity risk
2. Protocol risk assessment based on TVL, audit status, and time in operation
3. Impermanent loss exposure calculation for LP positions based on historical volatility
4. Risk exposure visualization with clear severity indicators (low/medium/high)
5. Risk factor explanations with educational tooltips for each risk type
6. Overall risk profile summary integrating all identified risk factors

## Story 2.6: Portfolio Comparison and Benchmarking
As a DeFi user,
I want to compare my portfolio performance and composition against common strategies,
so that I can evaluate my approach and identify optimization opportunities.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Benchmark comparison against common DeFi strategies (conservative, aggressive, yield-focused)
2. Performance comparison showing portfolio vs. benchmark returns (where calculable)
3. Composition comparison highlighting differences in asset allocation
4. Suggested adjustments to align with chosen benchmark strategy
5. Custom benchmark creation capability for users to define their target allocation
6. Benchmark performance tracking and historical comparison data

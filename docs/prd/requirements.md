# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

1. **FR1:** The system shall connect to user wallets via Wagmi/VIEM supporting MetaMask, WalletConnect, and other major wallet providers
2. **FR2:** The system shall display real-time portfolio data across Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Avalanche networks with accurate USD valuations within 10 seconds

# Epic 3: LP Position Tracking & Management

**Epic Goal:** Provide comprehensive liquidity provider position monitoring with detailed fee tracking, underlying asset breakdowns, rewards visibility, and performance analytics across major DEX protocols to establish the data foundation required for automation workflows.

## Story 3.1: Advanced LP Position Detection
As a DeFi user,
I want the system to accurately detect all my LP positions across protocols with detailed metadata,
so that I can see comprehensive information about each liquidity provision strategy.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Enhanced LP detection for Uniswap V2/V3, SushiSwap, Trader Joe, Pharaoh, Blackhole protocols
2. LP position metadata collection: pool address, fee tier, position range (for V3), creation date
3. Position status identification (active, out-of-range for V3, closed positions)
4. LP position grouping by protocol with clear visual organization
5. Position uniqueness validation to prevent duplicate displays
6. Support for wrapped LP tokens and complex position structures

## Story 3.2: Underlying Asset Breakdown Analysis
As a DeFi user,
I want to see the detailed composition of my LP positions showing underlying asset quantities,
so that I can understand my actual exposure to each token through liquidity provision.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Underlying asset calculation showing exact token quantities in each LP position
2. Asset breakdown display with both absolute quantities and percentage split
3. Current asset value calculation using real-time pricing data
4. Asset ratio change tracking (how ratios have shifted since position opening)
5. Total underlying exposure aggregation across all LP positions
6. Visual representation of underlying assets with clear token identification

## Story 3.3: Fee and Rewards Tracking System
As a DeFi user,
I want to track accumulated fees and pending rewards from my LP positions,
so that I can quantify the earnings from my liquidity provision activities.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Accumulated trading fees calculation and display for each LP position
2. Pending rewards detection for incentivized pools (SUSHI rewards, JOE rewards, etc.)
3. Fee and reward value calculation in USD with proper decimal handling
4. Claimable status indication with clear call-to-action buttons where applicable
5. Historical fee earnings estimation based on position duration and pool activity
6. Total claimable value aggregation across all positions and protocols

## Story 3.4: LP Position Performance Analytics
As a DeFi user,
I want to understand the performance of each LP position including impermanent loss calculations,
so that I can evaluate the success of my liquidity provision strategies.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Position performance calculation showing gain/loss since position opening
2. Impermanent loss calculation and display with clear explanations
3. APR/APY estimation based on fees earned and position duration
4. Performance comparison against simple holding strategy
5. Position performance history with basic time-series visualization
6. Performance ranking of LP positions to identify best and worst performers

## Story 3.5: Protocol-Specific Integration Enhancements
As a DeFi user,
I want protocol-specific features and optimizations focused on Pharaoh and Blackhole concentrated liquidity mechanics,
so that I can access unique functionality and data available on these advanced AMM protocols.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Pharaoh concentrated liquidity position range display and management alerts
2. Blackhole protocol-specific position mechanics and reward structures
3. Protocol-specific reward token identification and staking opportunities for both platforms
4. Pool-specific metrics: volume, liquidity depth, fee structures for Pharaoh/Blackhole
5. Cross-protocol position comparison with standardized metrics
6. Protocol documentation integration preparedness for when Pharaoh/Blackhole docs are obtained

## Story 3.6: LP Position Management Interface
As a DeFi user,
I want an intuitive interface to monitor and manage all my LP positions in one place,
so that I can efficiently oversee my liquidity provision portfolio without visiting multiple protocol interfaces.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Comprehensive LP positions dashboard with sortable columns and filtering options
2. Position detail modal with complete information and available actions
3. Quick action buttons for common tasks (claim fees, harvest rewards, view on protocol)
4. Position health indicators showing alerts for out-of-range or underperforming positions
5. LP portfolio summary with total value, total fees earned, and overall performance
6. Export functionality for LP position data and performance metrics

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Integration
From Story 1.2 completion:
- Wallet connection interface is fully functional and ready for visual testing
- localhost:3000 development server provides consistent testing environment
- shadcn/ui components create professional, testable UI elements
- Responsive design implementation can be validated across screen sizes

### Playwright MCP Configuration
**Windows-Specific Setup Requirements:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "@playwright/mcp@latest"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Technical Integration Points
[Source: Research Analysis - Technology & Innovation Research]
- **MCP Architecture**: Playwright MCP uses accessibility tree for deterministic browser control
- **Natural Language Interface**: Claude can control browser through plain English commands
- **Visual Capture**: 25 browser tools available including screenshot, navigation, interaction
- **Session Persistence**: Cookies and authentication state maintained across interactions

### Visual Testing Workflow Pattern
```typescript
// Example Playwright MCP workflow pattern
1. Navigate to localhost:3000
2. Capture baseline screenshots in multiple browsers
3. Interact with wallet connection interface
4. Capture state-specific screenshots (connected/disconnected)
5. Generate AI-powered visual analysis
6. Compare against design specifications
7. Provide actionable improvement recommendations
```

### Cross-Browser Testing Strategy
[Source: Research Analysis - Browser Compatibility]
- **Primary Browsers**: Chrome (primary), Firefox, Edge/Safari-equivalent
- **Viewport Sizes**: 375px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1440px (desktop)
- **Testing Approach**: Progressive enhancement validation
- **Performance Consideration**: Parallel capture to minimize testing time

### AI Visual Analysis Framework
**Analysis Categories:**
- **Layout Assessment**: Spacing, alignment, visual hierarchy
- **Typography Review**: Font choices, readability, size consistency  
- **Color Analysis**: Contrast ratios, brand compliance, accessibility
- **Interactive Elements**: Button states, hover effects, loading indicators
- **Responsive Behavior**: Mobile-first design compliance, breakpoint effectiveness
- **User Experience**: Flow clarity, error state handling, loading feedback

### Design Feedback Generation
**Feedback Structure:**
- **Visual Accuracy Score**: Comparison against design specifications
- **UX Improvement Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions for better user experience
- **Technical Implementation Notes**: Code-level improvements for visual elements
- **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG AA compliance validation
- **Cross-Browser Issues**: Browser-specific inconsistencies and fixes

### Project Structure Extensions
**New Files/Directories:**
- `docs/visual-testing/` - Visual testing documentation and guidelines
- `docs/visual-testing/screenshots/` - Captured screenshots for analysis
- `docs/visual-testing/feedback/` - Generated AI feedback reports
- `.mcp.json` - Project-level MCP configuration for team consistency

### Performance Considerations
- **Screenshot Optimization**: Capture only necessary elements to reduce processing time  
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-browser testing in parallel for efficiency
- **Caching Strategy**: Reuse screenshots when UI hasn't changed
- **Storage Management**: Organize and archive screenshots systematically

### Security and Privacy
- **No Sensitive Data**: Visual testing avoids capture of wallet addresses or private information
- **Local Development**: All testing performed on localhost environment
- **Screenshot Sanitization**: Automatic removal of any personal data from captured images

### Integration with Development Workflow
**Development Integration Points:**
- **Pre-commit Testing**: Visual validation before code commits
- **Design Review Process**: Automated comparison with design assets
- **CI/CD Integration**: Potential future integration with GitHub Actions

### Web3 Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **Authentication**: Wagmi v2 for wallet connections with Web3 authentication
- **Blockchain Interaction**: VIEM for type-safe blockchain interactions
- **Supported Wallets**: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, Rabby Wallet integration
- **Chain Support**: Ethereum (1), Arbitrum (42161), Avalanche (43114)

### Component Architecture Guidelines
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]
- **Web3 Components Location**: `apps/web/src/components/web3/`
- **Component Structure**: WalletConnection.tsx, NetworkSelector.tsx, TransactionButton.tsx, AddressDisplay.tsx
- **Layout Components**: `apps/web/src/components/layout/` for DashboardLayout, Header, Sidebar
- **Hook Organization**: `apps/web/src/hooks/` for custom wagmi-based hooks

### Wagmi Configuration Pattern
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#api-client-setup]
```typescript
// apps/web/src/lib/wagmi.ts configuration pattern
import { createConfig, http } from 'wagmi'
import { mainnet, arbitrum, avalanche } from 'wagmi/chains'
import { metaMask, walletConnect, coinbaseWallet, injected } from 'wagmi/connectors'
// Note: Rabby Wallet uses injected connector with proper detection
```

### Required File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#component-organization]
- **Wagmi Config**: `apps/web/src/lib/wagmi.ts`
- **Web3 Components**: `apps/web/src/components/web3/`
  - `WalletConnection.tsx`
  - `NetworkSelector.tsx` 
  - `AddressDisplay.tsx`
- **Layout Components**: `apps/web/src/components/layout/`
  - `DashboardLayout.tsx`
  - `Header.tsx`
  - `Sidebar.tsx`
- **Dashboard Pages**: `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/`
- **Mock Data**: `apps/web/src/lib/mockData.ts`

### Data Model Integration Requirements
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#portfolio]
Mock data must follow established TypeScript interfaces:
- **Portfolio Interface**: id, userId, chainId, totalValue (bigint), healthScore, composition
- **TokenBalance Interface**: tokenAddress, balance (bigint), metadata, priceUSD (bigint), valueUSD (bigint)
- **LPPosition Interface**: protocolId, poolAddress, underlyingAssets, totalValueUSD (bigint)

### State Management Architecture
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-patterns]
- **Wallet State**: Managed by Wagmi hooks (useAccount, useConnect, useChainId)
- **Dashboard State**: Use Zustand store for layout preferences and chain selection
- **Mock Data State**: Local component state or simple React context

### Routing Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#protected-route-pattern]
- **Protected Routes**: Dashboard routes require wallet connection
- **Connection Page**: `/connect` route for wallet connection flow
- **Route Groups**: Use `(dashboard)` route group for wallet-protected pages
- **Redirect Logic**: Redirect to `/connect` when wallet not connected

### Component Template Standards
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]
- **Import Patterns**: shadcn/ui components from `@/components/ui/`
- **Type Safety**: All components must have proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Loading states, error boundaries, and retry mechanisms
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance through shadcn/ui components

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]
- **Test Location**: `apps/web/tests/components/web3/` for Web3 components
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest + @testing-library/react
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock wagmi hooks for isolated component testing
- **E2E Location**: `apps/web/tests/e2e/auth/` for wallet connection flows
- **Component Tests**: Verify rendering, user interactions, and error states
- **Integration Tests**: Test wallet connection flow end-to-end

### Coding Standards Compliance
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Type Sharing**: Import shared types from packages/shared if needed
- **Environment Variables**: Access through config objects in lib/config.ts
- **State Updates**: Use proper state management patterns, no direct mutations
- **Component Naming**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for hooks
- **Error Handling**: Standard error patterns with user-friendly messages

### Project Structure Alignment

### Refactoring Performed

#### File: `apps/web/src/components/web3/AddressDisplay.tsx`
- **Change**: Removed console.error statement to comply with production code standards
- **Why**: Console statements should not be present in production code (ESLint rule violation)
- **How**: Replaced with silent error handling since clipboard API availability varies across contexts

#### File: `apps/web/tests/components/web3/AddressDisplay.test.tsx`
- **Change**: Fixed async test assertions and removed console error expectations
- **Why**: Tests were not properly handling async state updates and expected removed console logging
- **How**: Added proper waitFor wrapping for async assertions and updated clipboard failure test

#### File: `apps/web/src/test/components/page.test.tsx`
- **Change**: Added missing `createConfig` to wagmi mock exports
- **Why**: Test was failing due to incomplete wagmi mock causing import errors
- **How**: Extended the wagmi mock to include all necessary exports

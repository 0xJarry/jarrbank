# Design Asset Comparison Framework

## Overview
This framework provides systematic approaches for comparing design assets (Figma, Sketch, mockups) with implemented interfaces using Claude Code CLI and Playwright MCP for JarrBank.

## Design Asset Management

### Design Asset Preparation Checklist

#### For Design-to-Implementation Comparison
- [ ] Export designs at exact viewport sizes (375px, 768px, 1440px)
- [ ] Maintain consistent naming convention: `{component}-{state}-{viewport}.png`
- [ ] Include all interaction states (default, hover, active, disabled)
- [ ] Document design specifications (colors, typography, spacing)
- [ ] Export at 2x resolution for high-DPI comparison

#### Design Export Guidelines
```
Figma/Sketch Export Settings:
- Format: PNG (for precise pixel comparison)
- Scale: 2x (for Retina displays)
- Background: Transparent or match implementation
- Include: All layers, effects, shadows
- Crop: Exact component boundaries
```

## Visual Diff Analysis Methods

### 1. Side-by-Side Comparison
**Use Case:** Initial design review and major layout differences
**Process:**
1. Capture implementation screenshots using Playwright
2. Place design assets alongside implementation screenshots
3. Use AI analysis to identify discrepancies
4. Generate comparison report with annotations

### 2. Overlay Comparison
**Use Case:** Precise alignment and spacing validation
**Process:**
1. Overlay design asset on implementation screenshot
2. Use opacity blending to identify pixel differences
3. Highlight areas of misalignment
4. Measure spacing and sizing discrepancies

### 3. Automated Pixel Difference Detection
**Use Case:** Regression testing after design updates
**Process:**
1. Generate pixel-perfect difference maps
2. Calculate similarity percentages
3. Identify critical vs. minor variations
4. Track changes over time

# Design Implementation Fidelity Report

## Component: {Component Name}
## Viewport: {Mobile/Tablet/Desktop}
## Date: {YYYY-MM-DD}

### Overall Fidelity Score: {X}/10

### Visual Elements Analysis
| Element | Design Spec | Implementation | Match Score | Notes |
|---------|-------------|----------------|-------------|-------|
| Layout | [Design ref] | [Screenshot] | 9/10 | Minor spacing diff |
| Typography | Roboto 16px | Roboto 16px | 10/10 | Perfect match |
| Colors | #3B82F6 | #3B82F6 | 10/10 | Exact match |
| Spacing | 24px margin | 20px margin | 7/10 | 4px difference |
| Icons | [Design icon] | [Impl icon] | 8/10 | Slightly different size |

### Critical Discrepancies
1. **High Priority**: Spacing inconsistency affects visual hierarchy
2. **Medium Priority**: Icon size variation impacts brand consistency
3. **Low Priority**: Minor border radius differences

### Action Items
- [ ] Adjust margin from 20px to 24px to match design
- [ ] Resize icon to match design specifications
- [ ] Verify border radius implementation

### Implementation Quality Score: {X}/10
```

### State Comparison Matrix
```
# Component State Comparison Matrix

## Component: Wallet Connection Buttons
## States Analyzed: Default, Hover, Active, Disabled, Loading

| State | Design Asset | Implementation | Fidelity Score | Issues |
|-------|--------------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| Default | [asset] | [screenshot] | 9/10 | Perfect |
| Hover | [asset] | [screenshot] | 7/10 | Color variance |
| Active | [asset] | [screenshot] | 8/10 | Border missing |
| Disabled | [asset] | [screenshot] | 9/10 | Excellent |
| Loading | [asset] | [screenshot] | 6/10 | Animation differs |
```

## Implementation Comparison Workflows

### Workflow 1: New Feature Implementation Review
```yaml
trigger: New component implementation
process:
  1. Export design assets for all viewports
  2. Capture implementation screenshots across breakpoints
  3. Generate side-by-side comparison views  
  4. Run AI analysis using design comparison prompts
  5. Create fidelity assessment report
  6. Generate action items for design team
  7. Track implementation improvements
```

### Workflow 2: Design System Compliance Audit
```yaml
trigger: Quarterly design system review
process:
  1. Audit all components against design system
  2. Identify design token usage discrepancies
  3. Generate compliance scorecard
  4. Create remediation roadmap
  5. Update design system documentation
```

### Workflow 3: Responsive Design Validation
```yaml
trigger: Design updates or breakpoint changes
process:
  1. Export responsive design assets
  2. Capture implementation across all breakpoints
  3. Validate breakpoint transition fidelity
  4. Analyze mobile-first implementation accuracy
  5. Document responsive behavior gaps
```

## AI-Powered Comparison Prompts

### Design Fidelity Analysis Prompt
```
Compare this design asset with the implementation screenshot for the JarrBank wallet interface:

**Design Asset**: [Upload design file]
**Implementation Screenshot**: [Upload screenshot]

Analyze the following aspects:

1. **Layout Accuracy**: Are elements positioned correctly according to the design?
2. **Typography Fidelity**: Do fonts, sizes, weights, and line heights match?
3. **Color Compliance**: Are all colors exactly matching the design specifications?
4. **Spacing Precision**: Are margins, padding, and gaps implemented as designed?
5. **Interactive States**: Do button states and hover effects match the design intent?
6. **Brand Consistency**: Does the implementation maintain brand identity elements?

Provide:
- Overall fidelity score (1-10)
- Specific discrepancies with pixel measurements where possible
- Priority-ranked action items for improvement
- Assessment of user experience impact

Format as structured comparison report with actionable recommendations.
```

### Design System Compliance Prompt
```
Evaluate this component implementation against JarrBank design system standards:

**Component**: [Component name]
**Screenshot**: [Implementation screenshot]
**Design System Reference**: shadcn/ui with JarrBank customizations

Analyze:

1. **Design Token Usage**: Colors, typography, spacing, shadows
2. **Component Variants**: Proper use of size and style variants
3. **State Management**: Visual feedback for interaction states
4. **Accessibility**: Color contrast, touch targets, semantic structure
5. **Brand Integration**: JarrBank-specific customizations applied correctly

Rate compliance (1-10) and identify deviations from design system standards.
```

## Visual Diff Tools Integration

### Playwright Visual Comparison Setup
```javascript
// Example Playwright visual regression test setup
test('Wallet Interface Visual Comparison', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000');
  
  // Compare against baseline
  await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('wallet-interface-baseline.png');
  
  // Compare specific components
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="wallet-selection"]'))
    .toHaveScreenshot('wallet-selection-component.png');
});
```

### Design Asset Integration Workflow
```bash
# Prepare design assets for comparison
mkdir -p docs/visual-testing/design-assets/figma-exports
mkdir -p docs/visual-testing/comparisons

# Export from Figma/Sketch to standardized sizes
# 375px, 768px, 1440px viewports
# 2x resolution for retina comparison
```

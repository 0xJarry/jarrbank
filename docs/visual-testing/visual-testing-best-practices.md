# Visual Testing Best Practices - JarrBank

## Overview
This document establishes comprehensive best practices for visual testing using Claude Code CLI with Playwright MCP for the JarrBank DeFi platform.

## Core Principles

### 1. Test Early, Test Often
- **Integrate visual testing into development workflow from day one**
- Capture screenshots during initial component development
- Run visual comparisons with each significant UI change
- Establish visual regression testing as part of CI/CD pipeline

### 2. Comprehensive Coverage
- **Test all user-facing components across all breakpoints**
- Include all interaction states (default, hover, active, disabled, error)
- Validate both light and dark themes where applicable
- Test with real content, not just placeholder data

### 3. Consistent Methodology
- **Standardize screenshot capture procedures**
- Use identical viewport sizes across all testing sessions
- Maintain consistent browser settings and configurations
- Document and follow naming conventions religiously

## Screenshot Capture Best Practices

### Viewport Standardization
```yaml
standard_viewports:
  mobile:
    width: 375px
    height: 667px
    device: iPhone SE
  tablet:
    width: 768px  
    height: 1024px
    device: iPad
  desktop:
    width: 1440px
    height: 900px
    device: MacBook Pro
```

### Capture Settings Standards
```javascript
screenshot_settings:
  format: 'png'           // For pixel-perfect comparison
  quality: 90             // Balance file size vs quality  
  fullPage: true          // Capture entire scrollable content
  animations: 'disabled'  // Prevent animation-related flakiness
  timeout: 5000          // Wait for content to load
```

### State Capture Checklist
For each component, capture these states:
- [ ] **Default State**: Initial component appearance
- [ ] **Hover State**: Mouse over interactive elements  
- [ ] **Active State**: During click/tap interaction
- [ ] **Focus State**: Keyboard navigation highlight
- [ ] **Disabled State**: Non-interactive state
- [ ] **Loading State**: During data fetch/processing
- [ ] **Error State**: When errors occur
- [ ] **Success State**: After successful actions

## File Organization Standards

### Directory Structure
```
docs/visual-testing/
├── screenshots/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── wallet-interface/
│   │   │   ├── disconnected/
│   │   │   ├── connecting/
│   │   │   ├── connected/
│   │   │   └── error/
│   │   └── portfolio-overview/

├── feedback/
│   ├── automated-reports/
│   ├── manual-analysis/
│   └── comparison-reports/
└── baselines/
    └── approved-designs/
```

### Naming Conventions
```
Format: {component}-{state}-{viewport}-{timestamp}.png

Examples:
- wallet-interface-disconnected-mobile-2025-08-08.png
- portfolio-card-loading-desktop-2025-08-08.png
- nav-sidebar-collapsed-tablet-2025-08-08.png
```

## AI Analysis Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering Standards

#### Structured Analysis Prompts
Always include these elements in analysis prompts:
1. **Context**: What component/page is being analyzed
2. **Objective**: What specific aspects to evaluate  
3. **Criteria**: Specific metrics or standards to apply
4. **Format**: How to structure the response
5. **Action Items**: Request specific recommendations

#### Example Structured Prompt
```
Analyze this JarrBank wallet connection interface screenshot:

CONTEXT: Wallet selection component in disconnected state
OBJECTIVE: Evaluate design quality and user experience
CRITERIA: Layout clarity, visual hierarchy, accessibility, brand consistency
FORMAT: Structured report with scores and specific recommendations
ACTION ITEMS: Priority-ranked list of improvements

[Include screenshot]
```

### Analysis Consistency

#### Standard Evaluation Criteria
Rate each aspect on 1-10 scale:
- **Layout & Composition** (10-20%)
- **Typography & Readability** (15-20%) 
- **Color & Contrast** (10-15%)
- **Interactive Elements** (15-20%)
- **User Experience Flow** (15-20%)
- **Accessibility Compliance** (10-15%)
- **Brand Consistency** (10-15%)

#### Report Template Standardization
```markdown
# Visual Analysis Report Template

## Component: {name}
## State: {state}  
## Viewport: {size}
## Date: {date}

### Overall Score: {X}/10

### Detailed Scores
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Layout | X/10 | {specific feedback} |
| Typography | X/10 | {specific feedback} |
| Colors | X/10 | {specific feedback} |
| UX Flow | X/10 | {specific feedback} |

### Action Items
#### High Priority
- [ ] {actionable item}

#### Medium Priority  
- [ ] {actionable item}

#### Low Priority
- [ ] {actionable item}
```

## Responsive Testing Standards

### Breakpoint Testing Protocol
1. **Mobile First**: Always start with mobile viewport
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Verify functionality additions at larger sizes
3. **Content Reflow**: Ensure natural content adaptation
4. **Touch Targets**: Validate minimum 44px touch areas on mobile
5. **Navigation Patterns**: Test hamburger → full navigation transitions

### Cross-Device Validation
```yaml
device_testing_matrix:
  mobile:
    - iPhone_SE: 375x667
    - iPhone_12: 390x844  
    - Android_Standard: 360x640
  tablet:
    - iPad: 768x1024
    - iPad_Pro: 834x1194
    - Android_Tablet: 800x1280
  desktop:
    - Standard: 1440x900
    - Large: 1920x1080
    - Ultra_Wide: 2560x1440
```

## Quality Assurance Processes

### Pre-Release Visual QA Checklist
- [ ] All components tested across standard viewports
- [ ] Interactive states captured and validated
- [ ] Responsive behavior verified
- [ ] Error states tested and documented
- [ ] Loading states captured
- [ ] Accessibility requirements validated
- [ ] Brand guidelines compliance verified
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility confirmed (if applicable)

### Review Process Standards
```yaml
review_workflow:
  capture: Developer captures screenshots
  analyze: AI generates initial analysis
  validate: Design team reviews AI analysis  
  prioritize: Product team prioritizes action items
  implement: Development team addresses issues
  verify: QA team confirms fixes
  document: Update visual testing documentation
```

## Error Prevention Strategies

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

#### Screenshot Capture Issues
- **Inconsistent Timing**: Always wait for content to fully load
- **Animation Interference**: Disable animations during capture  
- **Font Loading**: Ensure web fonts loaded before screenshot
- **Dynamic Content**: Use consistent test data
- **Scroll Position**: Reset scroll position before capture

#### Analysis Quality Issues  
- **Vague Prompts**: Always provide specific, detailed analysis requests
- **Missing Context**: Include component purpose and user goals
- **Inconsistent Criteria**: Use standardized evaluation framework
- **Actionability**: Ensure recommendations are specific and implementable

### Validation Procedures
```yaml
screenshot_validation:
  - Check file size (>100KB, <5MB typical range)
  - Verify image dimensions match viewport settings  
  - Confirm no browser UI elements visible
  - Validate content is fully loaded
  - Ensure consistent lighting/contrast

analysis_validation:
  - Review for specific, actionable recommendations
  - Verify scores align with visual assessment
  - Check for technical accuracy
  - Confirm accessibility considerations included
  - Validate priority rankings make sense
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Git Integration Standards
```bash
# Create feature branch for visual testing
git checkout -b visual-testing/wallet-interface

# Commit screenshots with descriptive messages
git add docs/visual-testing/screenshots/
git commit -m "Add wallet interface screenshots across breakpoints"

# Include analysis reports
git add docs/visual-testing/feedback/  
git commit -m "Add AI analysis reports for wallet interface visual review"
```

### Pull Request Standards
Include in every PR with UI changes:
- [ ] Screenshots of new/modified components
- [ ] Visual analysis report
- [ ] Responsive behavior validation
- [ ] Before/after comparison (for modifications)
- [ ] Action items with timeline for addressing issues

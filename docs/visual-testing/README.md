# Visual Testing with Playwright MCP

## Overview
This directory contains visual testing artifacts generated through Playwright MCP integration with Claude Code CLI. The system enables automated UI analysis, design feedback, and visual consistency validation.

```

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Screenshot Capture
To capture screenshots of the current wallet connection interface:

1. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open Browser with Playwright MCP**
   ```bash
   # In Claude Code CLI with Playwright MCP enabled
   "Open a browser using playwright mcp and navigate to localhost:3000"
   ```

3. **Capture Interface States**
   - Disconnected wallet state
   - Wallet connection modal
   - Connected wallet with portfolio data

### Cross-Browser Testing
```bash
# Chrome (default)
"Take screenshots of the wallet connection interface in Chrome"

# Firefox  
"Switch to Firefox browser and capture the same interface"

# Edge/Safari-equivalent
"Test the interface in Edge browser for comparison"
```

### Responsive Design Validation
```bash
# Mobile viewport (375px)
"Set viewport to mobile size and capture wallet interface"

# Tablet viewport (768px)  
"Resize to tablet view and take screenshots"

# Desktop viewport (1440px)
"Switch to desktop resolution and capture final screenshots"
```

## Visual Analysis Framework

### AI-Powered Feedback Categories
1. **Layout Assessment** - Spacing, alignment, visual hierarchy
2. **Typography Review** - Font consistency, readability, sizing
3. **Color Analysis** - Contrast ratios, brand compliance, accessibility  
4. **Interactive Elements** - Button states, hover effects, loading indicators
5. **Responsive Behavior** - Mobile-first compliance, breakpoint effectiveness
6. **User Experience** - Flow clarity, error handling, loading feedback

### Quality Metrics
- **Visual Accuracy Score** (0-100) - Design-to-implementation fidelity
- **Accessibility Compliance** - WCAG AA standard validation
- **Cross-Browser Consistency** - Visual parity across browsers
- **Responsive Quality** - Mobile-first design effectiveness

## Best Practices

### Screenshot Naming Convention

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-Commit Visual Validation
Before committing UI changes:
1. Capture updated interface screenshots
2. Generate AI visual analysis
3. Address critical visual issues
4. Document visual changes in commit messages

### Design Review Process
1. Compare implementation screenshots with design assets
2. Generate design compliance report
3. Identify visual gaps and improvements
4. Iterate based on AI feedback

### Quality Assurance Enhancement
- Automated visual regression detection
- Cross-browser compatibility validation
- Responsive design verification
- Accessibility compliance checking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **MCP Connection Failed**: Restart Claude Code CLI to refresh MCP connections
2. **Browser Launch Error**: Ensure Playwright browsers are installed with `npx playwright install`
3. **Screenshot Capture Failed**: Check localhost:3000 server is running
4. **Viewport Issues**: Verify responsive design CSS is properly loaded

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check MCP server status
"List available MCP tools and their status"

# Test browser automation
"Open browser and navigate to localhost:3000 to verify basic functionality"

# Validate screenshot capture
"Take a simple screenshot of the current page to test capture functionality"
```

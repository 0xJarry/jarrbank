- Form labels: Clear, descriptive labels for all form inputs with error messaging

## Testing Strategy

**Automated Testing:** 
- Integration with axe-core for continuous accessibility testing
- Lighthouse accessibility audits in CI/CD pipeline
- Color contrast validation for all design tokens

**Manual Testing:**
- Keyboard-only navigation testing for all user flows
- Screen reader testing with NVDA/JAWS for Windows, VoiceOver for macOS
- Voice control testing for hands-free operation
- High contrast mode validation

**User Testing:**
- Testing with users who rely on assistive technologies
- Focus on critical DeFi workflows (wallet connection, transaction approval, portfolio review)
- Validation of financial data comprehension through screen readers

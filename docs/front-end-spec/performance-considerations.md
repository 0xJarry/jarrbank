# Performance Considerations

## Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** Initial dashboard load under 3 seconds on standard broadband (per NFR1)
- **Interaction Response:** UI interactions respond within 100ms, complex calculations complete within 10 seconds (per NFR2)
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60fps for all animations and transitions, even during heavy RPC data loading

## Design Strategies

**Progressive Loading Architecture:**
- Skeleton screens for immediate UI feedback while RPC data loads
- Critical portfolio metrics (total value, health score) prioritized over detailed breakdowns
- Lazy loading for LP position details and historical charts
- Service worker caching for static assets and price data with configurable TTL

**Data Visualization Optimization:**
- Chart rendering optimized for large datasets using Canvas API instead of SVG for complex visualizations
- Virtual scrolling for large transaction history lists
- Debounced search and filtering to prevent excessive re-renders
- Memoized component rendering for frequently updated financial data

**Network Efficiency:**
- Batched RPC calls to minimize rate limiting (per the RPC architecture requirements)
- Intelligent data prefetching based on user navigation patterns
- Compression for API responses and asset bundles
- CDN delivery for protocol logos and static assets

# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: Strict content security policy blocking unauthorized scripts
- XSS Prevention: Input sanitization and output encoding
- Secure Storage: Sensitive data encrypted in localStorage with expiration

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Zod schema validation for all API inputs
- Rate Limiting: 100 requests/minute per user for API endpoints
- CORS Policy: Restricted to frontend domain only

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies with SameSite protection
- Session Management: Automatic token refresh with sliding expiration
- Password Policy: N/A - wallet-based authentication only

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: <500KB initial JavaScript bundle
- Loading Strategy: Progressive loading with skeleton states
- Caching Strategy: TanStack Query with 30-second portfolio cache

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: <2 seconds for portfolio aggregation
- Database Optimization: Indexed queries with connection pooling
- Caching Strategy: Redis cache with 30-second RPC data TTL
